# Fitbit-Sleep-Score-Prediction
Final Project for Machine Learning course at UC Santa Barbara. Created statistical models and implemented machine learning algorithms in R to predict user Fitbit Sleep Score. Relevant statistical and machine learning concepts used in my project include: data wrangling, EDA, cross-validation, multiple linear regression, the lasso, ridge regression, regression trees, pruning, k-fold CV, random forest, bagging and boosting.
